# Privacy-Conscious Threat-Detection AI

## 🔍 Your idea in a nutshell
An anonymized AI surveillance system that detects unusual behavior patterns in public spaces without identifying individuals — unless legal thresholds are met. Designed to support national security without compromising civil liberties.

## 📚 Background
Traditional surveillance systems raise major privacy concerns. In Canada, there’s a growing tension between national security and individual rights. This AI system aims to assist defense agencies by flagging potential threats (e.g., suspicious movement patterns, loitering, abandoned objects) while upholding privacy-first principles.

## 📊 Data and AI Techniques
- **Data sources**: Anonymized CCTV/video feeds, motion data, environmental context (e.g., time of day, weather).
- **Techniques**: 
  - Computer vision for motion analysis
  - Anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forests or Autoencoders)
  - Optional use of facial/keypoint blurring
  - Differential privacy and edge computing to preserve identity
- Legal safeguards to only escalate identity data if flagged and legally required

## 🧑‍💼 How it is used
- Used by security and defense analysts in restricted areas (airports, borders, public buildings)
- Initial review happens anonymously
- Escalation protocol triggered by law enforcement only when high-confidence threat is detected

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Needs robust real-time performance
- Avoiding racial/gender bias in detection
- Requires large anonymized datasets
- Must pass legal and ethical review under Canadian law (e.g., Privacy Act, Charter of Rights)

## 🚀 What’s next
- Build prototype using publicly available datasets
- Engage with legal/ethics advisors
- Explore partnerships with Canadian defense research orgs (e.g., DRDC)
- Seek feedback from privacy advocates

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
- Inspired by: Elements of AI course, OpenAI’s Responsible AI principles
- Datasets: Possible use of PETS (Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance), AI City Challenge datasets (after anonymization)
